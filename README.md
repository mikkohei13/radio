# Ideas

Cursor:
Here are my suggestions to make the app feel more like a real radio experience:
Radio-Like Features to Add:
1. Transitions & Timing
Pause between songs: 1-2 second gap when transitioning (as you mentioned)
Fade effects: Gentle fade-out at end of song, fade-in for new song
Crossfade option: Overlap the end of one song with the start of the next
Random timing variation: Slight variation in pause duration (1.2-2.1 seconds) to feel more natural
2. Radio Station Behavior
Station identification: Brief station name announcement between songs
Station jingles: Short audio clips that play occasionally between songs
Time-based programming: Different songs at different times of day
Weather/time announcements: Simulated radio station features
3. Audio Enhancements
Audio normalization: Ensure consistent volume levels across songs
EQ presets: Different audio profiles per station (bass-heavy for some, clear for others)
Audio compression: Make it sound more "radio-like" with slight compression
Static/ambient noise: Very subtle background radio static
4. Visual Radio Elements
Station logo display: Show station logo in the now-playing area
Frequency display: Show fake radio frequencies (e.g., "FM 98.7")
Signal strength indicator: Visual bars showing "signal quality"
Station branding: Different color schemes per station
5. Interactive Radio Features
Request system: Simulated "call-in" requests (randomly suggest songs)
Radio host commentary: Text-based "DJ" comments between songs
Station history: Show recently played songs
Live listener count: Fake "listeners online" counter
6. Realistic Radio Timing
Commercial breaks: Occasional breaks with station identification
News updates: Simulated news segments (text-based)
Traffic reports: Fake traffic updates
Song dedications: Random "dedicated to" messages
7. Station Personality
Station-specific transitions: Different pause lengths and effects per station
Genre-appropriate behavior: Classical stations have longer pauses, rock stations are more energetic
Station slogans: Display station taglines occasionally
